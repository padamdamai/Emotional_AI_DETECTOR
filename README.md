<h1>Emotional AI Detector </h1>
<h3>Project Description</h3>

The Emotional AI Detector is an AI-based system that detects three primary human emotions: Happy, Sad, and Normal. Using machine learning (ML) algorithms, the system analyzes input data (such as text, voice, or images) and classifies the emotional state of the user.

This project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of AI in emotion recognition, which can be applied in fields such as customer service, mental health, and interactive systems.
Features

    Emotion Detection: Detects emotions like Happy, Sad, and Normal from user input.
    Machine Learning Model: Uses a trained ML model to predict emotions.
    User-friendly Interface: Easy-to-use system for real-time emotion detection.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

    Python
    Machine Learning: (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.)
    Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
    Data Visualization: Matplotlib (optional, if you visualize the data)
    Libraries: (e.g., OpenCV for image processing, librosa for audio features, etc.)
